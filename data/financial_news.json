Domestic and foreign client demand supported new business growth, as new export orders rose for a second month running. Job creation was also linked to greater pressure on capacity as backlogs of work returned to growth. Supplier shortages, higher interest rates and increased wage bills pushed cost burdens higher. Input prices consequently rose at the sharpest pace in five months.
