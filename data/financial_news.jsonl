This week, mortgage rates inched down slightly amid recent volatility in the banking sector and commentary from the Federal Reserve on its policy outlook, said Sam Khater, Freddie Macs Chief Economist.

Production rose at a marginal rate helped by easing supplier bottlenecks, while new orders declined the most in almost twoandahalf years due to greater client hesitancy amid marked inflation. Also, new export sales dropped sharply as dollar strength and challenging economic conditions across key export markets dampened foreign demand. Elsewhere, employment rose only modestly, due to costcutting measures, uncertainty regarding future demand, and lower production requirements.
